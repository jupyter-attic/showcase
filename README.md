[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/jupyter-incubator/showcase)

This repo showcases some projects in the Jupyter Incubation area in a click-to-try temporary notebook server provided by the (totally awesome) [Binder](http://mybinder.org) project. The binder image currently includes:

* Jupyter Notebook 4.1 with Python 2 and Python 3 kernels
* jupyter_dashboards, jupyter_declarativewidgets, jupyter_cms, and jupyter_dashboards_bundlers incubating extensions
* Example notebooks from the extension projects
* Spark 1.6.0 with pyspark (for some examples)

**Note:** Sometimes the Binder rebuilds without running the Dockerfile here for some unknown reason (e.g., someone clicking the button on the binder site with the wrong config?) If it's currently in a bad state, you can file an issue here for us to rebuild it or try most of the same tech on the tmpnb site at http://jupyter.cloudet.xyz.

## Contributing

If you have a project under https://github.com/jupyter-incubator and would like to mix your work in with the other projects show cased here, feel free to submit a PR. If your project makes more sense standalone, feel free to create your own Binder instead.
